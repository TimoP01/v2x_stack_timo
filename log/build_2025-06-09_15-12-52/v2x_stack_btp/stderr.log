  By not providing "Findros_etsi_its_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "ros_etsi_its_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ros_etsi_its_msgs"
  with any of the following names:

    ros_etsi_its_msgsConfig.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ros_etsi_its_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "ros_etsi_its_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "ros_etsi_its_msgs" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
